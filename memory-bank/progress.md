# Project Progress: Book Rental System

## What Works
- Project structure established following Clean Architecture principles
- Domain entities defined with complete properties and interfaces:
  - User entity with role-based access control
  - Book entity with inventory tracking capabilities
  - Category for organization taxonomy
  - Rental with status tracking and lifecycle methods
  - Payment with transaction processing and reporting
- Database schema designed with migration files ready
- API endpoints defined and handlers stubbed
- Documentation created for system overview and requirements

## What's Left to Build
- Authentication implementation (JWT token generation and validation)
- Repository implementations for all domain entities
- Service layer implementation with business logic
- User registration and management functionality
- Book catalog management operations
- Rental processing workflow (create, return, extend)
- Payment handling system (processing, refunds)
- Reporting and analytics features (revenue, usage)
- Middleware implementation for authentication and authorization
- Unit and integration tests
- Docker containerization for deployment

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Initial Setup/Domain Definition
- **Progress**: ~25% complete
- **Focus Area**: Repository layer implementation
- **Priority**: Authentication system implementation
- **Key Milestone**: Core domain models and interfaces defined

## Known Issues
- None identified yet - project in initial setup phase

## Evolution of Decisions
- Decided on Clean Architecture for maintainability and testability
- Selected Gin framework for API development
- Implemented consistent interface patterns across all domain entities
- Designed specialized query methods in repositories
- Developed status-based state management for rentals and payments
- Chosen PostgreSQL for relational data structure needs
- Determined JWT as authentication mechanism
- Established role-based access control approach
