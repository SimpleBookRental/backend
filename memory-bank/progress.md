# Project Progress: Book Rental System

## What Works
- Project structure established following Clean Architecture principles
- Domain entities defined with complete properties and interfaces:
  - User entity with role-based access control
  - Book entity with inventory tracking capabilities
  - Category for organization taxonomy
  - Rental with status tracking and lifecycle methods
  - Payment with transaction processing and reporting
- Database schema designed with migration files ready
- API endpoints defined and handlers stubbed
- Documentation created for system overview and requirements
- Application startup and configuration management implemented
- Logger integration for system-wide logging
- Server configuration with graceful shutdown handling
- Middleware chain setup for request processing
- Basic dependency injection framework established
- JWT-based authentication system with user registration, login, token refresh, and logout
- Book catalog management with CRUD operations, search, and availability tracking
- Rental operations with creation, returns, extensions, and overdue management
- Payment processing with fee calculation and transaction handling
- Reporting and analytics system with popular books, revenue, and overdue tracking
- IP-based rate limiting system for API protection

## What's Left to Build
- API endpoints integration testing
- User interface implementation
- Email notification system for due dates and overdue books
- Advanced search features with full-text search
- User profile management enhancements
- Admin dashboard features
- Performance optimizations
- Documentation updates

## PRD Features Implementation Status
- ✅ User registration and authentication
- ✅ Book catalog CRUD operations
- ✅ Book search and filter capabilities
- ✅ Rental operations (borrow, return, extend)
- ✅ Fee calculation system
- ✅ Payment processing
- ✅ Reporting and analytics functionality
- ❌ API documentation and usage examples (pending)
- ❌ Integration tests (pending)

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Core Implementation Complete
- **Progress**: ~80% complete (includes all core business logic implementation)
- **Focus Area**: Testing and integration
- **Priority**: API integration testing
- **Key Milestone**: All core business logic implemented

## Known Issues
- None identified yet - all critical components implemented

## Evolution of Decisions
- Decided on Clean Architecture for maintainability and testability
- Selected Gin framework for API development
- Implemented consistent interface patterns across all domain entities
- Designed specialized query methods in repositories
- Developed status-based state management for rentals and payments
- Chosen PostgreSQL for relational data structure needs
- Determined JWT as authentication mechanism
- Established role-based access control approach
- Added structured logging throughout the application
- Implemented graceful shutdown with context timeouts for production stability
- Enhanced rental service with automatic overdue detection
- Added comprehensive fee calculation based on rental duration
- Integrated payment processing with rental lifecycle events
- Implemented custom in-memory rate limiting instead of third-party dependencies
