# Project Progress: Book Rental System

## What Works
- Project structure established following Clean Architecture principles
- Domain entities defined with complete properties and interfaces:
  - User entity with role-based access control
  - Book entity with inventory tracking capabilities
  - Category for organization taxonomy
  - Rental with status tracking and lifecycle methods
  - Payment with transaction processing and reporting
- Database schema designed with migration files ready
- API endpoints defined and handlers stubbed
- Documentation created for system overview and requirements
- Application startup and configuration management implemented
- Logger integration for system-wide logging
- Server configuration with graceful shutdown handling
- Middleware chain setup for request processing
- Basic dependency injection framework established

## What's Left to Build
- Authentication implementation (JWT token service structure exists but needs endpoint integration)
- Repository implementations for all domain entities
- Service layer implementation with business logic
- User registration and management functionality
- Book catalog management operations
- Rental processing workflow (create, return, extend)
- Payment handling system (processing, refunds)
- Reporting and analytics features (revenue, usage)
- Authorization middleware for role-based access control
- Unit and integration tests
- Docker containerization for deployment
- API documentation and usage examples

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Initial Setup and Core Infrastructure
- **Progress**: ~30% complete
- **Focus Area**: Repository layer and authentication implementation
- **Priority**: User authentication system implementation
- **Key Milestone**: Core infrastructure and startup sequence implemented

## Known Issues
- None identified yet - project in initial infrastructure phase

## Evolution of Decisions
- Decided on Clean Architecture for maintainability and testability
- Selected Gin framework for API development
- Implemented consistent interface patterns across all domain entities
- Designed specialized query methods in repositories
- Developed status-based state management for rentals and payments
- Chosen PostgreSQL for relational data structure needs
- Determined JWT as authentication mechanism
- Established role-based access control approach
- Added structured logging throughout the application
- Implemented graceful shutdown with context timeouts for production stability
